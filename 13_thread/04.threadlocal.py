# A global variable local_school is an ThreadLocal object, each Thread of which can read and write student 
# properties to it, but do not affect each other. You can think of it local_school as a global variable, 
# but each attribute local_school.studentis a local variable of the thread, which can be read and written arbitrarily 
# without interfering with each other, and there is no need to manage the lock problem, ThreadLocal 
# which will be handled internally.

# It can be understood as a global variable local_school, dict which can not only be used local_school.student, 
# but also bind other variables, such as local_school.teacher and so on.

# ThreadLocal 
# The most commonly used place is to bind a database connection, HTTP request, user identity information, etc. 
# for each thread, so that all the called processing functions of a thread can easily access these resources.

############################################ Summary#############################
# Although a ThreadLocal variable is a global variable, 
# each thread can only read and write an independent copy of its own thread without interfering with each other. 
# ThreadLocal Solved the problem that parameters are passed to each other between functions in a thread.
