#What is Jupyter?
# Jupyter is a web application(※) that acts like a container for data science projects. 
# It allows you to put data, code, visualizations, documentation, and more into a single notebook.

# I’ll be honest, if you’re an experienced software developer who is accustomed to an IDE like 
# Eclipse or a text editor like Visual Studio Code, Jupyter is going to seem weird.

# Jupyter is, essentially, a modern reincarnation of Donald Knuth’s Literate Programming. 
# Literate programming aims to break down the barriers between code and natural language. 
# In a typical literate programming file, programming code is interspersed with prose in a natural English-
# like language that describes what the code does.

# This approach might sound repugnant to modern developers. 
# After all, shouldn’t your code be so clear and self-explanatory that it doesn’t need comments?

# That may be true for ordinary, mechanical code where it’s clear what is going on. 
# But the situation is different when you’re writing code for data science and machine learning projects. 
# In these scenarios, you’re often writing code that’s going to be consumed by a wider audience including 
# data scientists, business analysts, and even managers.

# In those cases, your code alone isn’t enough. Even if the reader understands the code, you must add 
# prose to give context to your code — to help readers understand why you wrote the code you did, 
# and understand how your code is transforming the data it imports.

# Jupyter Notebooks take literate programming a step further. Not only is it easy to write a document that 
# alternates between prose and code, the code is also live and executable. You can run the code and 
# observe its output from inside the document. Even better, colleagues who have a copy of your notebook 
# can edit your code, re-run it, and observe the new output — all without leaving the notebook. 
# A notebook that contains code, prose, and output
